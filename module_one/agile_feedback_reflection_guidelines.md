# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

I have learned that in terms of software projects the preferred workflow would use the agile method over waterfall. Waterfall is a straight down snowball approach that can lead to little problems or bugs pilling up over the course of a project. While the agile method gives a dev team the ability to break up a project and routinely check and fix an problems or bugs during a project instead of a large mess at the end.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)? 

We were given and used Trello to track what iteration we were on and more specifically what part of an iteration we, or each one of us was assigned to work on. Once completed we would pass that on over to a section of done but not checked code. We would then review it, make sure it was integrated smoothly, and that the whole group had an understanding of it before we moved on. 

3. What role did you take on in the project? 

This project we did a great job of working together for most of it. So I felt very much a solid 1/3 of the team that was able to contribute evenly on each portion of the project. 

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?

I think coming to a project even more organized in terms of day by day goals would be helpful on future projects. We did a great job of staying on track, but I feel we could have been even better with a little more organization. 

5. How does retro function in a team project?

Retros function as a way to review how a project went, what worked, what didn't, what could be improved. It's a way to come together as a team in an open environment to share any feedback necessary to improves processes for future projects. 

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?

In retros I like to go over what went well first, then go into what I think could be improved, and end with positives on collaboration and personal wins. I started expressing the exact feeling I was feeling and it was great to see the difference in reactions rather than just straight up telling someone how to do something. Made it much easier to get to the point of what I'm trying to explain. 

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?

I think my ability to communicate feedback is good, I am able to articulate what I'm thinking pretty well and without hurting feelings. I would like to improve the way I present feedback to be less business like and add more feeling into it to help convay the feedback better.
